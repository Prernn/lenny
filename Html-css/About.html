    <blockquote class="story">  Since my childhood i was somehow connected with music. During my schooling i used to observe the music band playing Drums, Harmonium, congo, casio. Then Dad brought me a little keybord and i started playing some basic tunes with practicing over and over again.
        After that Dad brought me another keyboard having five octaves and I started playing more tunes and some trending music and I participated in couple of competitions. When I was in 7th standard Dad Gifted me a bigger and professional casio, and again I participated in couple or competitions and got first Prize 3 times and second prize 2 times. Then luckily my piano classes started but because of Tenth boards I had to leave it all. So that was my journey with piano.
